        <h3 class="helpitem">What is KyberLock Universal?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
    <p>KyberLock Universal is a Chrome extension that makes your email private by <strong>encrypting it end-to-end</strong> so only the intended recipients can decrypt your message. It follows the Crystals-Kyber encryption standard, designed to be resistant to attack by quantum computers. The encryption code is the same as in the standalone KyberLock, except that it integrates with any email service without cut and paste. It also includes the powerful <strong>Key synthesizer and manager</strong> SynthPass.</p>
    <p> You can encrypt rich text messages, images, and files in <em>Signed mode</em>, which allows you and the recipients to decrypt them again as often as necessary, in <em>Read-once mode</em>, which allows recipients to decrypt them only once, in <em>Shared-Key mode</em>, if you already share a secret Key with the recipients, or in <em>Anonymous mode</em>, which allows you to hide your identity as a sender.</p>
    <p>You can also set up <strong>real-time secure chat sessions</strong> involving text, files, audio, or even video, using the WebRTC protocol. The connection is direct between participants, with a server getting involved only at the start to help connect the participants to one another.</p>
    <p>Unlike most other email encryption apps, KyberLock Universal <strong>does not involve any servers</strong>. It only communicates with the email page, and minimally so, in order to maintain a high level of security. Your secret Key (which you should <em>never</em> give to anyone), is not stored anywhere and remains in memory only as long as necessary to do its job.</p>
    <p>And then, if you are really paranoid, KyberLock Universal can <strong>disguise its output</strong> so it does not look encrypted at all, or inside a picture that you send as an attachment. It can also hide a second, undetectable message that is encrypted under a different key.</p>
    <p>If you click the KyberLock Universal icon while viewing a login screen, it will synthesize a high-security Key for that website. You only need to supply your Master Password, which can be the same for all websites and isn't stored anywhere.</p>
    <p>Finally, if KyberLock cannot do any of the above, clicking the icon opens a box where you can write and save some secure notes about the website. There is also a button to reload the page inside an isolating frame, eliminating cookies, recording into the browser history, and interaction with other extensions, plus links to some of our apps and secure search pages.</p>
    <p>If you want a little more encryption capability you may want to try the <b>KyberLock</b> extension, also available from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kyberlock/clbacjlmpddhfempfnjmigmhecbmlfio" target="_blank">Chrome store</a></p>, which includes the full set of KyberLock functions. There's also the standalone app <b>KyberLock</b>, available from <a href="https://KyberLock.com/app" target="_blank">https://KyberLock.com</a>.  Messages encrypted in KyberLock Universal can be decrypted in KyberLock, and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>KyberLock Universal is built on a highly secure crypto engine, but the app itself is <em>still in experimental phase</em>, as it has not yet been duly vetted by experts. Bear this in mind before entrusting sensitive information to it. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/fruiz500/KyberLock" target="_blank">https://github.com/fruiz500/KyberLock</a>. Please use this page to report bugs or suggest improvements.  </p>

        <h3 class="helpitem">How do I use KyberLock Universal with email?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
    <p>The first time you encrypt or decrypt anything, KyberLock asks you to come up with a secret Key. You must remember this Key and <em>never give it to anyone</em>, not even your friends. KyberLock gives you a score as you type it and tells you how long it will take to process it. The lower the score, the longer it takes to process, so it is better to come up with a good Key. After a little delay, KyberLock displays a mnemonic "hashili" word related to your Key in order to reassure you that you typed it correctly. Click the eye icon to see the whole Key.</p>
    <p>As soon as you click<strong></strong> the KyberLock icon (which looks like this: <img src='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQBAMAAADt3eJSAAAALVBMVEX////e+92N64sj1yAS1A4g1h3r/esr2Shn5GUZ1Ras8que7p1E3kHz/vIH0QR8RPHAAAAATElEQVQI12NAAklq3N1ghsi0Ja/ADNGqEgUwQ9jcgwHCiDwLYxxjQJOqNlkAYYSpFEIYgTxvLkAYjEoJYEZEE0SxpN8kCOOSkjayGwDEjxCBjxaTdgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='>) on the browser, the <strong>first visible</strong> encrypted message loads automatically and KyberLock Universal decrypts it, possibly asking you first for your Key. If the sender's Key has changed, KyberLock Universal will inform you and ask you to identify the sender again. You can also do this on a message that simply contains the sender's Lock in the signature area, in order to encrypt messages for this sender.</p>
    <p>To send an encrypted message, click the <strong>Compose</strong> or <strong>Reply</strong> button in your email page, and then do this:</p>
    <ol>
            <li>No harm filling in the recipients' addresses, and perhaps the subject line (neither are used for encryption, anyway), but <em><strong>do not</strong></em> write the text that you want to be encrypted (otherwise the email server might have it, unencrypted, as soon as you type it).</li>
            <li>Click the KyberLock icon near the top right of the browser. A dialog will open where you can write your confidential message and add images or file attachments. By default, KyberLock shows only the buttons for the most important functions; if you want to see all of them, click &#9658;.</li>
            <li>Select the recipients on the box above the message (ctrl-click to select several or deselect). You can send encrypted messages in Anonymous, Signed, Chat, or Read-once mode only if they are on this list. For Shared Key mode, click the list heading.</li>
            <li>If you are fine with the default options (Signed mode, visible output, no hidden message), just click <strong>Encrypt to email</strong> after writing your message. Otherwise click &#9658; and set the options as described in the help item below before clicking the button.</li>
            <li>The message will then be encrypted and placed back in the email compose or reply window. Add whatever plain text or attachments you want, plus recipients' addresses and subject if they're still empty, before sending it out in the normal way. Beware: attachments added this way <em>will not be encrypted</em>. If you want them encrypted, load them as in step 2 or follow the instructions below about encrypting files.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want to correspond with new people, you must send them an invitation first, or receive an encrypted message from them. To do this, proceed as indicated above but click the <strong>Invite</strong> button instead. Be aware, however, that the contents of invitation messages are <em>not secure</em>, and anyone in the world can decrypt them. You can also send to the recipient a text file containing only your Lock, consisting of the first fifty characters of any message encrypted by you (up to but not including a series of six slashes ////// ) with extension .txt, possibly sent by a different channel. In this case, they'll have to load it as if they were loading an encrypted file (the process is described below), which won't decrypt, but after that they'll be able to send you encrypted messages.</p>
    <p>If you put your KyberLock Lock in your email signature, other KyberLock users will be able to correspond securely with you without a previous invitation. To display your Lock, click the <strong>my Lock</strong> button on any KyberLock decrypt window (may have to click &#9658; first in order to see the button). It is a good practice to also add a link to a video where you read your Lock's fingerprint, which is displayed near the top of the window when you click <strong>my Lock</strong>, with some background music for added security. This way other users will be sure that the Lock in your email signature is authentic.</p>
    <p>All of this is explained in this video made for the very similar PassLok for Email app: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomKUA4PcAI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomKUA4PcAI</a></p>

      <h3 class="helpitem">How do I fill a password for a website?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
  <p>
    <p>When a password field is visible on a webpage, do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the KyberLock logo near the top right of the browser.</li>
      <li>The popup will contain writable boxes for your Master Password (which does not have to be the same as your secret Key used for encryption) and an optional serial, plus the user ID if there is a single extra box on the webpage, and the Password length (default is 44). The serial box will be filled already if you used a serial on this website before, as well as the user ID and the length etc. If you have used your Master Password within the last five minutes, this box will be filled also. To make a PIN consisting only of digits, type 'pin' in the <em>length</em> box (default is 4 digits), or 'pin6' (6 digits) and so forth.</li>
      <li>Type in your Master Password if needed. As you type, its strength and entropy are displayed near the top of the dialog. If you stop typing for a second, a mnemonic "Hashili" word is displayed in the message area to reassure you that your typed it correctly. Clicking the eye icon reveals the complete Master Password. When you are satisfied, click <strong>OK</strong> or press the <strong>Enter</strong> key. There is also a button to additionally put the generated password into the clipboard, in case that website needs you ti enter it again; just paste it.</li>
      <li>When the popup disappears, the password and user ID fields on the webpage will be filled, but login has not yet taken place. Proceed from this point on as if you had typed in user ID and password directly into the webpage. Sometimes a website requires that you physically type something in the password box; in this case it is enough to click in the middle of the password (which you won't see), type a character, and then immediately press the Delete or Backspace key to remove it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the popup says that it cannot see the password field or displays more than one box for the Master Password, you may need to paste in the synthesized password manually. The process for this is explained two Help items below this one.</p>
    <p>There is a 3-minute video on YouTube explaining all of this with examples, amde for the similar SynthPass app: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLGScvETOEc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLGScvETOEc</a></p>
    <p>The next set of help items are all about encryption. Help items dealing with Key management are near the bottom of the page.</p>
  </div>

  		<h3 class="helpitem">What options are available for encryption?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
  	<p>
  	<p>You can see all the options on the encrypt dialog after clicking &#9658;. To go back to default options (Signed mode, visible output, no hidden message), click the backward arrow.</p>
  	<p>There are five encryption modes you can use, selected by radio buttons at the bottom:</p>
  	<ol>
      <li><strong>Anonymous</strong>: the sender is not identified and no Lock is included; useful when using a dummy email address, or when no prior exchange has taken place</li>
  	  <li><strong>Signed</strong> (default): the message can be decrypted multiple times, and the sender is authenticated</li>
  	  <li><strong>Read-once</strong>: the message can be decrypted only once</li>
  	  <li><strong>Chat</strong>: to make an encrypted invitation to join a real-time chat</li>
  	  <li><strong>Shared Key</strong>: a special Key or passphrase known both to sender and recipients is used for encryption</li>
  	  
    </ol>
  	<p>There are also some options for how the encrypted message will look, also selected at the bottom:</p>
  	<ol>
  	  <li><strong>Visible</strong>: output looks like gibberish</li>
  	  <li><strong>Concealed</strong>: output looks like a normal text, which you supply</li>
  	  <li><strong>Invisible</strong>: the encrypted message cannot be seen at all</li>
    </ol>
  	<p>The message can contain an undetectable second message if the <strong>Hidden message</strong> box is checked. An additional dialog will pop up to ask you for the message and its separate Key.</p>
  	<p>You also can select where the encryted output goes, by clicking one of three blue action buttons:</p>
  	<ol>
  	  <li><strong>Encrypt to email</strong>: output is text, which is copied into the email page's compose or reply box.</li>
  	  <li><strong>Encrypt to file</strong>: output is a file with extension .kyb represented as a link, which you can save locally with a button on the toolbar, then add to your email as an attachment; use this when the output is large.</li>
  	  <li><strong>Encrypt to image</strong>: a dialog pops up so you can select a local image and optionally (but highly recommended) add a special shared Key. When you select Encrypt to PNG or Encrypt to JPG, the encrypted message is embedded into the image, which you can then right-click on and save locally, then add to your email as an attachment.</li>
    </ol>
  </div><hr>
  		<h3 class="helpitem">What if my friends don't have Chrome, or are on a mobile platform?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
    	<p>If they don't have Chrome, or a browser compatible with its extensions, or are using a mobile device, they can still use<strong> KyberLock</strong>, which is fully compatible with KyberLock Universal, especially if you select to add your Lock in its <strong>Options</strong> tab. KyberLock does not include any password-management functions, but then you can get those from the <strong>SynthPass</strong> web app, which has been especially designed for mobile platforms. This might be useful for yourself as well, if you need to log into a website from a mobile device.</p>
    	<p>KyberLock is available for free from <a href="https://KyberLock.com/app" target="_blank">https://KyberLock.com/app</a>, plus the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kyberlock/clbacjlmpddhfempfnjmigmhecbmlfio" target= "_blank">Chrome store</a>. SynthPass mobile is available for free from <a href="https://synthpass.com/app" target="_blank">https://synthpass.com/app</a></p>
  </div><hr>
        <h3 class="helpitem">Can I change my encryption secret Key?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
          <p>Sure! Just type in a new Key when you reload your email page. Since  data needed by Read-once mode is stored encrypted with the Key, you may be asked to supply the old Key in order to access that data.</p>
    <p>If you change your Key, KyberLock running on the recipients' end will notice, and will ask them to accept the change, but things will continue normally after that. Be sure to tell them that you have changed your Key.</p>
    <p>For additional assurance, attach a short video clip of yourself reading the fingerprint of your new Lock, which is displayed along with the Lock by clicking the <strong>my Lock</strong> button. A good place to put the URL for the video is your email signature. If your email service insists on converting the link into an actual video, put some parts of it in italics.</p>
    <p>If you use multiple email services, KyberLock will keep them separate even though you may have chosen to use the same secret Key. To the recipients, they will behave as completely separate senders.</p>
    <p>If you are using KyberLock as well and want to maintain compatibility, be sure to supply your exact email when asked.  </p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <h3 class="helpitem">Can I change machines?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
    <p>Sure you can! The extension syncs your data automatically through the Chrome sync service, so that it is available to you as soon as you log into Chrome. All the confidential data is encrypted, so the sync servers can't see what it is or allow others to see it. If you want to make a local backup, though, here is the process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open a compose window in your email and then click the KyberLock icon. The dialog that appears contains a special <strong>Invite</strong> button that disappears as soon as you click on a recipient on the list. When you click it leaving the main box empty, KyberLock Universal encrypts all its encryption data (not the Key-related data) and places it in the dialog as a link. Right-click on it and select <strong>Save Link As...</strong> so you can save it as a text file. Should you want to wipe the local data without deleting the extension itself, KyberLock will give you a chance to do this for ten secons, by clicking the same button again.</li>
            <li>When you start KyberLock Universal on a different machine, click on the KyberLock icon for any incoming message, load the backup file into that dialog as if it were an encrypted attachment, and enter the same secret Key as before. The data will be loaded, possibly modifying data that might already be there (KyberLock will ask for confirmation).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Bear in mind that the synced data remains available even after a wipe, but you can always delete it by removing the extension from your Chrome account. After you reinstall it, it will come back clean of any previous data. If you want to make sure that your data has been wiped from a particular machine you were using, remove your login from Chrome on that machine by going to <strong>Settings</strong> on the Chrome menu, and clicking the <strong>Disconnect</strong> button.</p>
  </div><hr>
    	<h3 class="helpitem">What is Read-once mode?</h3>
        <div class="helptext">
			<p>
          <p>The default encryption mode is Signed, meaning that someone who is not the legitimate sender could not have been able to encrypt the message without causing KyberLock to warn you that the sender's Key has changed. This is why messages forwarded from one recipient to another always fail to decrypt. But these messages are stored in the email server and can be decrypted again mutiple times, so long as the correct Key is written when requested. If the message is encrypted in Read-once mode, however, old messages fail to decrypt even if the correct Key is supplied. Experts call this "Forward Secrecy."</p>
          <p>To achieve forward secrecy, you only need to select the <strong>Read-once</strong> radio button before clicking one of the <strong>Encrypt</strong> buttons (you may need to click &#9658; first). The recipient does not need to do anything special, only to avoid re-decrypting the first Read-once message from a given sender, or one that had reset the conversation at some point in the past, since this would erase the data needed to keep the exchange going at the current point. You will be warned when this is about to happen, so you can cancel before damage is done. It is best to delete those messages as soon as they are read since they don't possess forward secrecy.</p>
          <p>If despite being careful a new Read-once message fails to decrypt, KyberLock offers the possibility to reset the conversation by clicking (twice) a button that will appear in that eventuality.</p>
          <p>All of this is explained in this video for the very similar PassLok Universal app: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiiX9hg4PrQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiiX9hg4PrQ</a></p>
        </div><hr>
        <h3 class="helpitem">How does Chat work?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
          <p>If you select <strong>Chat</strong> option at the bottom of the dialog before clicking <strong>Encrypt to email</strong> or <strong>Encrypt to image</strong> (you may need to click &#9658; first) a dialog asks you what kind of real-time chat you want to set up. There are four choices: text and files, this plus audio, all this plus video, and Jitsi, which is full-featured except for files. You can also add a short message, such as the exact time to start the chat session.</p>
    <p>After you click <strong>OK</strong>, KyberLock makes an encrypted chat invitation, which you can then send to the participants of the chat. This invitation contains the short message mentioned above (limit 43 characters) plus some data needed to establish the connection.</p>
    <p>When the recipients get your chat invitation, they will decrypt it like any other KyberLock message and then the short message will pop up and ask for confirmation to continue (this is so they don't join the chat too early, if set for a later time). After this the chat will open on a separate tab and ask you to supply a name for yourself. When each participant does this, an encrypted connection is established with one another without any server in-between. They also may be asked to grant permission to feed audio or video when the connection takes place. The original sender connects exactly the same way, by decrypting the chat invitation he/she sent to the others.</p>
    <p>If you get disconnected, just reload the chat tab in your browser and type your alias again. The chat session ceases to exist when all participants close their chat tabs.</p>
    <p>All of this is explained in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2qN5TUdSk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2qN5TUdSk</a></p>
  </div><hr>
  		<h3 class="helpitem">How do I use a shared Key?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
          <p>Sometimes you do have a secret Key or passphrase that somebody else also knows. KyberLock lets you use it by selecting the <strong>Shared Key</strong> option (you may need to click &#9658; first in order to see it) before clicking the appropriate Encrypt button. Another way to activate this mode is to click on the header of the recipients' list rather than any particular recipient. A dialog will open to ask you for this special Key. When you click OK, the message is encrypted and placed into the email compose window, from where you can send it normally.</p>
    <p>When a recipient clicks the KyberLock logo on the browser, a dialog asks for the special shared Key (perhaps after asking for the regular Key), and then the decrypted message is displayed.</p>
          <p>This mode uses three different sub-modes, which are selected automatically depending on the shared Key:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Normal</strong> mode is triggered with most shared Keys. It uses the XChaCha20 stream cipher, and is very fast and secure.</li>
            <li><strong>Pad</strong> mode is triggered when the shared Key is <em>very long</em>, typically five times the length of the message itself. This mode has security comparable to that of a "one time pad", which cannot be broken even by brute force or quantum computers. For added security, KyberLock will ask for the starting position in the text supplied as Key, which sender and recipients must also know.</li>
            <li><strong>Human</strong> mode is triggered when the shared Key consists of four strings separated by tildes (~), with an optional number after another tilde. This mode remains very secure, and has the advantage that recipients <em>do not need a computer</em> in order to decrypt the message. Very useful after you've been hacked. The details of the algorithm are explained in this Web page: <a href="https://KyberLock.com/human" target="_blank">https://KyberLock.com/human</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Shared Key is typically more secure than the modes where no Key is shared beforehand, but the problem remains of how to share that Key securely. Often a personal meeting is the best way to do it.</p>
          <p>All of this is explained in this video for the similar PassLok for Email app: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B--WbQ8ubhg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B--WbQ8ubhg</a></p>
  </div><hr>
  		<h3 class="helpitem">What is Anonymous mode?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
    <p>Sometimes the sender is not using his/her regular email, or there hasn't been any prior communication to allow the recipient to store the sender's Lock so he/she can be recognized. In Anonymous mode, KyberLock does not identify the sender, in order to provide some help in these situations. Encryption proceeds as in the other modes, except that the <strong>Anonymous</strong> option must be selected at the bottom of the window prior to encryption (you may need to click &#9658; first in order to see it).</p>
    <p>The recipient will decrypt this type of message in the same way as the other modes, and will see a warning that the sender has not been authenticated. Since there isn't any kind of sender authentication, recipients should be careful with these messages, which could have been encrypted by anyone with access to the sender's email account (but does not know his/her secret Key). The sender's Lock is not included in Anonymous messages, and therefore it is not stored for future use.</p>
    <p>All of this is explained in this video for the similar PassLok Universal app: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk_qrAX7_G8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk_qrAX7_G8</a></p>
  </div><hr>
        <h3 class="helpitem">Can I encrypt files?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
          <p>Chat has its own secure file-sending process, so we refer here to sending files by email. You have two options:</p>
    <p>1. Encrypt the files using AES with an archiving utility such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip</a> (Windows), <a href="http://www.kekaosx.com/" target="_blank">Keka</a> (OSX), or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/p7zip" target="_blank">p7zip</a> (Linux), then lock the Key for the files inside an encrypted email message, and attach the encrypted archives through the email program's compose or reply window. This is best for large files.</p>
    <p>2. You can attach files by clicking the next to rightmost icon on the formatting toolbar, which looks like this: <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABIAAAASCAMAAABhEH5lAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAD19fVcXFwbGxsTExP8/PzT09NxcXFaWlo4ODg1NTUEBAT5+fnw8PDr6+vU1NTIyMi+vr6Xl5dsbGxnZ2dXV1dISEghISEMDAw0f0rSAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAFBJREFUGNO9yEkOgCAQBMBmUxDc9/9/VJ2EjgkHb9axcJuceqQRtMq4aAdWkDr6xtW5jJRFx2MBu23fdS7eG6Vz0U8VytrKmhMnVoDQlOfbBQLIAl4FF2fyAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" />,  and then encrypt them as a regular message. After decryption, the recipient can save the files with a button. You can add text above or below the encoded file.</p>
    <p>In the second case, be aware that the encrypted output may be quite large and the email page may clip it, rendering it impossible to decrypt. To prevent this, click the <strong>Encrypt to file</strong> button rather than Encrypt to email. The encrypted item will appear as a linked .kyb file, which you can then save locally by clicking the rightmost button on the toolbar, and then add it to your email as an attachment.</p>
    <p>The recipient will then save the attachment and load it back into KyberLock's decrypt dialog (there is a <strong>Decrypt file/image</strong> button for this, visible after clicking &#9658;), and then the file will decrypt automatically. This button also allows loading the sender's KyberLock Lock (any format supported by KyberLock will work) from a .txt file rather than from an invitation message, which might be useful for sharing someone else's Lock.</p>

        <h3 class="helpitem">How about inserting images, rich formatting?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
  		<p>
  		<p>Images that you want to encrypt can be inserted in the same way as formatted text. Simply click the second from the right button on the formatting toolbar, which looks like this: <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABIAAAASCAMAAABhEH5lAAAAbFBMVEUAAAAAAAAmJibm5uaJiYnZ2dnn5+e5ubmBgYHNzc3z8/Pr6+vW1ta2trZ/f3/y8vLQ0NDPz8/Dw8OgoKCOjo54eHgcHBwGBgb+/v7T09PIyMi+vr6srKyEhIRqampiYmJbW1tPT08qKioRERGLOctyAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAHJJREFUGNOtzkkShCAQRNFKbLsVsZ3nWe9/R8EAYeHSv6u3qEh6qo0/TkUiKULNbCglfZGSjf0vCvWZLTmxwBBXVGG1NO2D+hoIQ6IHmrKrciJDfgxIBGbPId12E//pUjOiyHydCGtFyQG3kWTcc4ro1U7vPAUU4TAxJQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" /></p>
  		<p>A dialog will open so you can load whatever local image you wish. Bear in mind that images can be large in data size, so the email service may end up clipping the encrypted message. KyberLock will warn you in that event, so you can encrypt it to a file instead, and load it as an attachment.</p>
  		<p>If the image comes from a website, you have the option to open that website on a separate browser window and drag the image into KyberLock, or do a copy/paste operation. In this case, the image will load as a link to the external website, which will make the encrypted message much smaller. This may pose security concerns, however.</p>
  		<p>Images loaded into the email's compose or reply windows before clicking the KyberLock don't have any security (in fact, they may be uploaded to the email server immediately and without encryption, so don't do it), and are stripped when the KyberLock encryption dialog loads.</p>
  </div><hr>
  <h3 class="helpitem">I don't want my messages to look encrypted to a casual observer</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
        <p>
        <p>Then you'll love KyberLock's <strong>Concealed</strong> and <strong>Invisible</strong> modes, which you can select at the bottom of the encrypt dialog  (you may need to click &#9658; first), prior to clicking an <strong>Encrypt</strong> button.The default mode is <strong>Visible</strong>.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Concealed</strong> mode, a popup will ask you to supply a cover text, which will be used to hide your encrypted message. Paste in something long (otherwise it may be repeated, which is not so good), and click <strong>OK</strong>. Your message will be encrypted and then encoded into the letters and spaces of the cover text, and then placed back in the email page's compose or reply window. It will look like the original cover text.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Invisible</strong> mode, the encrypted output is put into invisible characters located at the end of a standard greeting, which you can edit as you please. No cover text is necessary. This mode is especially handy when encrypting files or long pieces of text, which otherwise might be clipped by the email service.</p>
        <p>On the receiving end, KyberLock Universal will detect that the text contains a hidden or invisible message and decrypt it as usual, even if the text has been saved to a file.</p>
        <p>Concealed and Invisible modes can be used together with Hidden message mode and any of the encryption modes. Concealed mode is explained in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8WnayDPVYk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8WnayDPVYk</a>.

		<h3 class="helpitem">It is essential that no one can tell I'm using encryption</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
        <p>
        <p>The text hiding modes described in the previous help item provide good protection against visual inspection, but they cannot stand against automated scanners that are looking for them. In this case you want to hide the encrypted message <em>inside an image</em>, which you then send as an attachment. You do this by clicking the <strong>Encrypt to image</strong> button (you may need to click &#9658; first), which opens a dialog where you can select a locally saved image that will act as a container for the encrypted data.</p>
        <p>When the image loads, a message tells you if it has sufficient capacity to contain the data. If not, you can always select another image. At this point you have the option to type in a special Key, which the recipient must also have. Using a Key makes it much more difficult to even detect the presence of encrypted data, so it is highly recommended. If there is only one recipient, the Key box is pre-filled with a string based on the recipient's own Key, which will be supplied also on the receiving end. Then you click either <strong>Encrypt to PNG</strong>, to make a png image, or <strong>Encrypt to JPG</strong>, to make a jpeg image. It does not matter what the format of the original image was. PNG images have a much larger capacity, but they are less common.</p>
        <p>A message tells you when the embedding process is complete (the image will hardly change at all), and then you can save the image locally by right-clicking on it. Then load it into the email directly or as an attachment, making sure to instruct the email page to keep the original file.</p>
        <p>The recipient will save the attached image (from the email body, NOT by right-clicking it on a lightbox, which often shows a modified image), and then will load it back on the image dialog (possibly after clicking &#9658; so the appropriate button is visible) by clicking <strong>Decrypt file/image</strong>. After the image is loaded and the special Key is written in its box (pre-filled with a secret string based on his/her own Key and the sender's, which most likely you should replace with something else if there are several recipients), clicking <strong>Decrypt</strong> extracts the hidden data and then decrypts it. If the extraction process succeeds, the dialog closes (decryption may still fail, though). If the extraction process fails, a message will tell you that either the image does not contain anything or the Key is wrong. The method has been designed so there is no way to tell if an image contains hidden data other than by extracting it successfuly.</p>
        <p>For the very paranoid, KyberLock can add a second hidden message encrypted under a separate Key, undetectable even to those possessing the regular image Key. To embed a second message, write a vertical bar "|" after the image Key, then the Key for the second message, another vertical bar, and then the second message before clicking one of the two Encrypt buttons. To reveal this message, write a vertical bar after the image Key, and then the second Key before clicking the Decrypt button. If succesful, the second message will appear on the decrypt dialog.</p>
        <p>Encryption into images is explained in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1LfZyCxB9o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1LfZyCxB9o</a></p>
  </div><hr>
  <h3 class="helpitem">What is Hidden message mode?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
        <p>
        <p>When you turn on the <strong>Hidden message</strong> option at the bottom of the encrypt dialog  (you may need to click &#9658; first), KyberLock includes a second message (limit 160 characters), which is encrypted under a separate key. Its presence is undetectable, and it won't make the encrypted result any longer or shorter. This is the process to use this mode:
        <p>When you are the sender:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Check the <strong>Hidden msg.</strong> box, in addtion to setting the encryption mode and optionally Concealed or Invisible mode, and click an <strong>Encrypt</strong> button after you have typed in the main message.</li>
          <li>A dialog asks you for the hidden message and the special shared Key. Click <strong>OK</strong> after you have supplied everything.</li>
          <li>Encryption proceeds and the result appears in the email page's compose or reply window, from where you can send it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you are the recipient:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Decrypt the message normally by clicking the KyberLock icon, then click the <strong>Hidden msg.</strong> button in the decrypt dialog (you may need to click &#9658; first).</li>
          <li>A dialog asks you for the Key for the Hidden message.  Enter the Key and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
          <li>Then if all goes well the decrypted hidden message appears at the top of the decrypt window. If not, you'll get a message stating that no hidden message was found.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most of these things are explained in this video for the similar PassLok for Email app: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFCrETTwySw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFCrETTwySw</a></p>

   <h3 class="helpitem">KyberLock Notes pops out</h3>
   <div class="helptext">
   <p>
   <p>This is what KyberLock does when it cannot see encrypted material or a password to be filled. It could be that you are trying to decrypt a message encrypted in Invisible or Concealed mode, or simply you want to display the decryption dialog in order to decrypt a file or an image. Here's an easy fix to tell KyberLock that there is indeed something to decrypt:</p>
   <p><em>Select the text</em> to be decrypted before you click the KyberLock icon. This overrides the automatic detection of encrypted data, and loads what you have selected as data to be decrypted.</p>
   <p>If, on the other hand, this is what you wanted, well and good. You can edit the notes at will. They will be saved when you click <strong>Save</strong>. The notes are encrypted under your Master Password, which can be different from the secret Key used for email encryption.</p>
   </div>
   <hr>
        <h3 class="helpitem">Something is not working with encryption or decryption</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
  <p>
    <p>It may be that KyberLock Universal is not detecting an encrypted message because it is too short or weirdly formatted. To force the app to deal with a particular piece of text as an encrypted message, just select it before you click the KyberLock icon.
    <p>If a new Read-once message fails to decrypt even though your Key is correct, this could be because you have already decrypted other messages from the same sender that were generated after that one. The un-decryptable message has "missed its turn," so to speak, when later messages were decrypted. Ask the sender to re-send the contents in a newly encrypted message. No reset is needed.</p>
    <p>A new Read-once message can also fail to decrypt if  the  hidden data needed for Read-once mode have become corrupt of failed to sync. In this case you will be offered the opportunity to reset the conversation with the sender by clicking a special Reset button.</p>
    <p>A message containing files or a long piece of text might have been clipped by the email service so that only the beginning is shown. Since the server is withholding some of the data, there isn't much that can be done with that message if the email service does not offer a way to display the complete message. Ask the sender to split the text into several shorter messages, or encrypt it to file and send it as an attachment. Some services, Gmail for instance, will display the entire message on a separate tab if requested. Then you can simply save that page locally as an html file, click the KyberLock icon on the message (which will fail to decrypt), and load the html file you just saved as if it were an encrypted attachment. Decryption should restart at that point.</p>
    <p>Second messages encrypted into images use whatever space is left by the main message, which is not known beforehand. Therefore it is possible that an encryption to image may fail for lack of space even though the image has a large capacity. If this occurs, use a different image or shorten the second message, and try again.</p>
  </div><hr>
        <h3 class="helpitem"> Are there any vulnerabilities?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
          <p>We have tried to make KyberLock Universal extremely easy to use without impacting security, but tradeoffs do exist. There are a few issues that you must be aware of:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Users are not fully authenticated</strong>. This means that someone could gain access to your correspondents' email accounts and impersonate them without your realizing it.  If your correspondent switches to a new secret Key he/she should tell you about it, because KyberLock Universal will warn you that his/her Key has changed (in Signed, Chat, and Read-once modes; the other modes don't check). From time to time you should ask your correspondents to send you something that only they could produce (for instance, selfie pictures where they do something you requested in your previous message). To further protect you against a "man in the middle," follow the instructions in the next help item.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Not all messages have the same level of security</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
            <li>Invitations have no security at all, as they can be read by anyone anytime. This is why KyberLock asks you to click the button twice.</li>
            <li>Signed and Anonymous mode messages can be decrypted forever by anyone who has acquired the recipient's or the sender's secret Key at the time of the encryption.</li>
            <li>Messages initiating a Read-once exchange and Read-once messages encrypted right after a reset are secure against third parties reading them, but they can be decrypted indefinitely both by sender and recipient, just as Signed messages. The replies to those can be decrypted more than once, but only until a new reply is made.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>3. <strong>Concealed or invisible text is only so to humans</strong>. So that if your email is being scanned for the special characters used in these modes, those will be found right away. The same thing can be said about encrypting to image without adding a special Key: anyone will be able to load the image into KyberLock and extract the hidden data; but if you do use a special Key for the image, it will be extremely hard to tell that there is anything special about the image. Likewise, messages added via the Hidden msg. option are completely undetectable to anyone not possessing its special Key.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Hackers could change the code</strong> at the Google or Firefox servers, and thereby destroy all security without users realizing it. You can, however, inspect the code and compare it with the authentic code published on GitHub. Instructions for this are in a help item below.</p>
  </div><hr>
        <h3 class="helpitem">Click here for instructions against a "man in the middle"</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>
          <p>The easy way: ask your correspondent to read over the phone (or in an audio or video chat session) the fingerprint of his/her Lock, which is displayed near the top of the KyberLock window when you decrypt a message sent by that person (click &#9658; if you don't see it). You  can make it easy for everyone to authenticate you by making this video as soon as you change your Key, and adding its URL to your email signature. Your Lock's fingerprint is displayed when you click the <strong>my Lock</strong> button.</p>
          <p>If you have a copy of the standalone KyberLock (which make it easy to split messages and send only a part), you can also send a person whom you know and who knows you the following message or something like it, which implements something called the "interlock protocol". Copy it and change it as you see fit before sending it:</p>
    <p><br>
            <em>Dear So-and-So:</em><br>
            <em>I want to make sure there is no "man in the middle" of our KyberLock exchanges. Here's what I want you to do:</em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Write me an encrypted message where you ask me to take a picture or video of myself doing something of your choice. Then split the encrypted message (the gibberish part) into two and send me only the first half.</em></li>
            <li><em>When I receive your first half, I will also write a reply asking you to do something in a picture or short video. I'll send you half of my encrypted message. When you get it, go ahead and send me the other half of your encrypted message.</em></li>
            <li><em>When I get your second half, I'll put the two halves together and decrypt your message. Then, following your instructions I'll send you the picture or video right away, not encrytped, along with the second half of my encrytped request.</em></li>
            <li><em>When you get it, please verify that what I sent conforms to your instructions. If so, put together the two halves of my encrypted message, decrypt it, and send me what I ask in the message as soon as possible, also not encrypted. Then I'll know that there is no one between us.</em></li>
          </ol>
    <p><em>Many thanks. Sincerely, This-and-That</em>  </p>

    <h3 class="helpitem">How do I change a website password?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>When you reach a password change webpage, clicking the KyberLock icon will open a popup containing several rows, one for each password field on the page, arranged in the same order, plus a box for password length. This is what you do next:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Type in your Master Password in the first box corresponding to the old password, if it was made by KyberLock Universal. Type the old serial, which should appear on the first row, into the boxes next to them. Add the user ID and other options if the boxes are not populated already. Default length is 44, and the password is composed of capitals and smallcase letters, numbers, and the characters !#_  If you omit typing in a password or serial box, KyberLock will use the value in the box above it.</li>
      <li>To use what you type in the password box as-is, without any synthesis, and without storing it (like when you are going to use a KyberLock-made password for the first time), type a minus sign ( - ) in the serial box to its right. To use something else, which will be stored, write your Master Password in its box, and a plus sign (+) in the serial box. A popup will ask you for the new website password, which will be remembered and stored in encrypted form.</li>
      <li>Do the same for the box or boxes corresponding to the new password. Typically this will involve simply a new serial, and in this case it is enought to type it in the corresponding box or boxes. Again, if a box is left empty, the value above it will be used. To revert to not using a serial, type a space in that serial field. You can change your Master Password at this point, by typing in a new one.</li>
      <li>To make KyberLock Universal remember the new serial, click on it or the password box to its left to make sure it is highlighted before clicking OK. Then click <strong>OK</strong>. If you want the password to be copied to clipboard as well, click the <b>&#9658; Clip</b> button instead.</li>
      <li>When the popup disappears, all the password fields, new and old, will be filled. Proceed from this point onward as if you had filled them manually. If your old password was not made by KyberLock but the "old password" box was filled, you may want to re-type it into the box.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is a 3-minute video on YouTube explaining all of this with examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96pSh4h1CAU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96pSh4h1CAU</a></p>

    <h3 class="helpitem">Something is not working, but I still want to synthesize a password</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
  	<p>Sometimes websites don't accept the special characters used by KyberLock Universal, which are these three <strong>!#_</strong> Sometimes they change their own web address without warning, which will change the password that KyberLock makes for it.</p>
    <p>Other times the website won't accept the password until you have actually typed into that box. Just click on the filled password, type any character somewhere inside, then delete it immediately.</p>
    <p>And sometimes you encounter websites that just don't want to cooperate. This is why we have the little dialog below, which works exactly like the popup to synthesize a single password, and displays the result so you can edit it, copy it, and paste it manually. Since this help page is no longer connected to the website you want to log into, there is an extra box to enter the website name (just the last two words, as in "KyberLock.com", case insensitive), which KyberLock Universal would have taken directly from the website. You also need to supply the serial, if any, and the length or special characters to include if different from the !#_ set. None of this data will be remembered. Because this dialog does not involve storage, it does not work with user-supplied passwords.</p>
    <p>For your protection, the input fields will be cleared after the password is synthesized, and the output field when it is copied to clipboard. Clicking the title of this help item clears the output as well.</p>

    <h3 class="helpitem">KyberLock says my Master Password is Terrible</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>This is probably because it has a very low entropy, which means it is very easy to guess. Hackers are going to crack your Master Password by trying combinations of words, possibly with obvious character substitutions such as 0 instead of o. KyberLock Universal contains a sophisticated password-scoring algorithm that awards points for each word and each letter or character. If a word is on its blacklist of 10,000 most used passwords, it gets no points.</p>
    <p>KyberLock compensates for low entropy by adding extra computations, so that even known bad passwords are still allowed. Execution will be slow, however, unless your Master Password gets at least a Medium score.</p>
    <p>So do yourself a favor and experiment a bit until you come up with a Master Password that scores high and is still easy to remember. Once you find it, you won't have to change it again.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
    <h3 class="helpitem">I can't remember my Master Password</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>Then you won't be able to generate passwords for any websites. Sorry. Neither the Master Password nor the synthesized website passwords are stored anywhere. User-supplied website passwords are stored, but they cannot be decrypted without the Master Password.</p>
    <p>This is where Hashili comes in handy. It is likely that you mistyped your Master Password or it's missing something. Try varying what you type as you look at its Hashili fingerprint (it appears one second after you stop typing). Hashili is hard to remember, but easy to recognize once you get the right one.</p>
    <p>If all else fails, most websites have a link to reset your password after verifying your email address. Next time make sure you use a Master Password that you can remember. High entropy is nice, but the app will take a low entropy password just as well.</p>

    <h3 class="helpitem">A box for Notes pops out</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>This means that KyberLock has not detected encrypted data, or a place to write it in, or passwords to be filled. When none of these things can be done, KyberLock Universal offers you the ability to write some notes about the website, which will be securely encrypted when you click <strong>Save</strong> (you may be asked for your Master Password). These notes are different for each website, and are synced between machines like everything else.</p>
    <p>There is also a button that will move the page into an "isolation cage," where the browser won't load cookies for it or allow other extensions to see it. History won't be recorded in the browser, either, though the websites themselves may record what you do. Think of it as an extra "incognito mode" within the main set of tabs. There is an extra address box to load other pages, and a list of secure search engines and other apps similar to KyberLock, which will load into the cage. This function is also available for links, via the right-click menu.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
    <h3 class="helpitem">Where are the options?</h3>
  <div class="helptext">
    <p>KyberLock Universal does not have general options, but sometimes a website allows only passwords of a certain length or composition. To take care of this, you can enter some additional data in the <strong>length</strong> box, which will be remembered next time you load that website. These can be entered in any order:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>To limit the length to a certain value, enter the numeric value in the box (as in 20, or 15)
    <li>To output only numbers, enter "num" or "pin" without the quotes (or any word that contains those strings, such as "number"); default length is 4
    <li>To force alphanumeric output, without any special characters, enter "al" without the quotes (or any word that contains that string, such as "alpha"); default length is 44
    <li>To use certain special characters instead of the default !#_ set, enter them in the box; default length is 44, with the first character in the set appearing at the beginning
    </ul>
    <p>For example, entering "30 numbers" (again, no quotes) in the Length box, causes the generated password to contain 30 numerical digits, and no letters or special characters. If you enter "@$%*&amp;" (no quotes) the generated password will be the default 44 characters long and will be composed of letters (smallcase and capitals), numbers, and those special characters (and no others). If you write "alphabetic 25" (no quotes), the generated password will contain a total of 25 letters (small and capitals) and numbers, with no special characters.</p>

Alternatively, you can download the .crx file directly from Google (and then skip step 2 below) by following <a href="https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?response=redirect&prodversion=49.0&x=id%3Dehakihemolfjgbbfhkbjgahppbhecclh%26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc" target="_blank">this link</a> (Chrome will display a message saying it won't install the extension, but it will download it as a file anyway).</li>
      <li>Paste in the link to KyberLock Universal in the Chrome store, which is this (wrong link): <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/KyberLock-for-email/ehakihemolfjgbbfhkbjgahppbhecclh" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/KyberLock-for-email/ehakihemolfjgbbfhkbjgahppbhecclh</a> Then click the <strong>Download Extension</strong> button. This will download a fresh copy of KyberLock Universal from Google, as a .crx file.</li>
      <li>Obtain the SHA256 hash of the file you just downloaded using a utility such as <a href="https://www.bitser.org/checksum-calculator-windows-7-freeware.shtml" target="_blank">Bitser</a> for Windows, sha256sum in Linux, or shasum -a 256 in OSX, or a web service such as Online-convert (<a href="https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator" target = "_blank">https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator</a>) or Defuse (<a href="https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm" target="_blank">https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm</a>).</li>
      <li>Get the authentic SHA256 for KyberLock Universal Chrome extension, which is published in these places:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>KyberLock Universal GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/fruiz500/KyberLockUniversal" target="_blank">https://github.com/fruiz500/KyberLockUniversal</a></li>

      </ul>
      <li>If the published hash matches what you obtained from the .crx file, all is good; go ahead and install KyberLock Universal by dragging the .crx file into Chrome's Extensions page, if it wasn't installed already. Otherwise something is wrong and you should not trust KyberLock Universal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Firefox addon:</em></p>
    <p>As with the Chrome extension, you can always open a Wed console (under the "Developer" icon in the menu) to look at the source code. The code can be seen on the consolle, at the Debugger tab. Select the approrpiate parts of the code on the left. The following is in case you want to check the published SHA256 of the packaged code:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to KyberLock Universal in the Firefox addon store, which is this (wrong link): <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/KyberLock-Universal/" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/KyberLock-Universal/</a> Then right-click the <strong>Add to Firefox</strong> button and select <strong>Save Link As</strong>... This will download a fresh copy of KyberLock Universal from Mozilla, as a .xpi file.</li>
      <li>Obtain the SHA256 hash of the file you just downloaded using a utility such as <a href="https://www.bitser.org/checksum-calculator-windows-7-freeware.shtml" target="_blank">Bitser</a> for Windows, sha256sum in Linux, or shasum -a 256 in OSX, or a web service such as Online-convert (<a href="https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator" target = "_blank">http://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator</a>) or Defuse (<a href="https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm" target="_blank">https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm</a>).</li>

    <p>
    <p>KyberLock Universal is a self-contained piece of code that does not rely on servers to do its job. Therefore:</p>
    <p><strong>1. We cannot give your secret Key or Master Password to anyone</strong> (not even yourself) because we don't have them. Your keys are never stored or transmitted, and get deleted from memory after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p><strong>2. We cannot give your private data to anyone</strong> because KyberLock Universal only interacts with the email page. When the extension loads you get only the code, without any cookies, plugins, or anything of that sort. We get back <em>nothing</em> from you. Google and Mozilla do store other people's Locks, plus some data needed for Read-once conversations, but it is encrypted under your secret Key before it is sent to them. As far as we know, they do not look at this data or share it with anyone.</p>
    <p><strong>3. We cannot eavesdrop on your chat sessions, or enable anyone to do so.</strong> Establishing a chat session does involve contacting a signaling server and giving it your IP address and a disposable chatroom name so that others can contact you; the signaling server never sees the content of your chat, which is between participants only. The email servers don't even see the connection data.</p>
    <p><strong>4. We will never weaken the cryptography methods contained within the free KyberLock Universal at the request of a third party, private or public (regardless of what the email server might do).</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We would rather shut down KyberLock than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of our efforts. If we learn that a counterfeit version of KyberLock Universal is circulating, whether placed by hackers or government agencies, we will make the fact known to users.</p>
    <p><strong>Notices:</strong></p>
    <p>Since KyberLock Universal is distributed as a piece of human-readable code, we consider it an expression of free speech protected by the laws of many countries. Putting into circulation tampered versions of KyberLock Universal, whether by individuals or public entities, violates free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
    <p>KyberLock Universal contains strong cryptographic methods, which may be illegal in some countries. Please check the local laws before using KyberLock Universal.</p>
    <p>KyberLock Universal is intended to protect professionals and innocent citizens from hackers and abusive surveillance. It is not intended to facilitate any form of crime. Please refrain from using it if your intention is to commit a crime.</p>

    <p>This paragraph and the canary logo above attest to the fact that, up until the release of version 1.0.3 (March 2025) we have not received any requests under gag order for user data or modifications of the code. This paragraph will be periodically updated as this situation continues, and will be removed if a request such as described above is received.</p>
